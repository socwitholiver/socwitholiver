 🧠 About Me

Hi 👋 I’m Oliver — an IT student with a deep interest in **cybersecurity and SOC operations**.

I enjoy:
- 🔍 Investigating suspicious logs like a digital detective  
- 🚨 Learning how attackers think (so I can ruin their day)
- 🧪 Building hands-on security labs instead of just reading slides

Currently focused on:
- Blue Team fundamentals  
- SIEM & log analysis  
- Malware behavior (yes, including trojans 👀)

> I believe security is not about tools — it’s about mindset, curiosity, and asking “what could go wrong?”
